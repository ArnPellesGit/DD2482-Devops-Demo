# Getting Started with Dagger

This project was bootstrapped with Vite

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


### Deployment

The demo is about how we can write a plan that can be executed systematically.

The `Netlify` plan is built by **Dagger**, but the `Surge` plan is built locally by @landeholt
